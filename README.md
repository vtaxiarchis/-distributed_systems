Labs for "TDA596 - Distributed Systems" course

### What is this repository for? ###

We implemented a distributed blackboard application, using a subset of the Python programming language. Starting from a simple (barely working) implementation, it will evolve over the labs to a fully working distributed application with different properties. We tested our implementation on the Seattle platform, a platform for networking and distributed systems teaching & research. In the context of these labs, Seattle allows us to run and evaluate our implementation on different machines distributed around the world.
